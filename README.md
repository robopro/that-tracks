# There's a weirdly comprehensive Web Audio API?
Well, That tracks.

# Demo
insert url

# Get it up and running
Just clone the repo and open index.html in your browser.

# Features
Save and load projects (they do _not_ save automatically).
Load custom filters.


# Additional notes
Written in HTML, CSS and TypeScript. Code is pre-compiled in repo, so everything is ready to run. But the ts files are there if you wanna mess around.
If you've got typescript installed globally you probably already know what to do.
If not just `npm install` and run `npx tsc` to compile.
